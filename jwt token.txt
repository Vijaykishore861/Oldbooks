creating Web api for the users JWT (json web tokens)
1 if the user is accessing the api they should need to have tokens to authenticate the API
2 using the jwt token method,we will be creating the token

header :secret_key = secret_key()
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30


dependencies 
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm - oauth2 passwordBearer is used as the security token in which it will bear the token 

class Token(BaseModel):
    access_token: str
    token_type: str
bearer token model access_token str and token_type : bearer
OAuth2PasswordRequestForm - request form is a form will be displayed in the screen and need to give the username and password.

from passlib.context import CryptContext-Helper for hashing & verifying passwords using multiple algorithms.
Instances of this class allow applications to choose a specific set of hash algorithms which they wish to support,
set limits and defaults for the rounds and salt sizes those algorithms should use, flag which algorithms should be deprecated,
and automatically handle migrating users to stronger hashes when they log in.
